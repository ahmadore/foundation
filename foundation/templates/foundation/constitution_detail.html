                            <p>1. Agaie is traditionally known for educational advancement, especially in area of Islamic Education for about two centuries. 
                            The learned Islamic Jahadist, Mallam Muhammadu Mallam Babba founded Agaie in early 19 Century. The efforts of Mallam Babba to propagate
                            Islamic Religion through proper education of his followers earned Agaie the slogan of ’Agaie town of the learned’. However, the 
                            current trend of decline in the education standard of Agaie indigenes is as a result of neglect.</p>
                            
                            <p>2. The ongoing educational backwardness and decay within generations of Agaie Emirate Youth needs immediate intervention. Hence, 
                            the need for education endowment fund for improvement of education to empower our people. As part of community development by concerned
                            citizens especially in the area of education, an Education Foundation shall be established to address our future needs.</p>
                            
                            <p>3. The education foundation is to support the less privileged and orphans within Agaie Emirate. The foundation shall be named after 
                            Alhaji Etsu Nuhu II (OON), Lafarma Agaie, a renowned educationalist who taught for 45 years in various primary schools.</p>
                            
                            <p>4. The foundation shall start with the support of students of post secondary institutions. In due course, primary and secondary
                            education shall be added. Thereafter, other aspects of life such as Health, Water Resources, Agriculture, Poverty alleviation shall
                            be considered.</p>
